# Join in!

* [x] Why not have a go at adding another button to click.

# Next things to do

1. Describe or list some of the features of this app on here! (How is it used, etc.)
1. [x] Once a new user is added, hide the popover form.
1. How will new users be told about the aleady existing players?
1. How can we also share the game state (i.e. Curent progress)?
1. Can we tally the number of wins into a table
1. How about saving the table into a leaderboard?
1. What if you changed the games into timed rounds that start at once, instead of its continuous form now.
